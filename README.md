# My Personal Vim Config
Just my prefered Vim config so I can pull down my .vimrc file for any new machine.

- Make sure you have cloned the Vundle.vim git repo into the HOME directory.
`git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`


- After you clone the repo just mv the vimrc file to ~/.vimrc
